Code examples from my talk about scripting in clojure. The shortcut programs used are defined in `clj.sh`. Using it *(`source clj.sh`)* will let you use `clj_1` and `clj_2` from the command line. Here are the prerequisites/instructions for using each:

### clj_1
 - `brew install drip`

### clj_2
 - `brew install leiningen grenchman`
 - `lein repl :headless`
 - in a separate window `export GRENCH_PORT=[FILL IN PORT NUMBER FROM PREVIOUS COMMAND]`
